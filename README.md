DEVELOPMENT
- The "Unlimited Recipes" app is based in Node, Express, and Mongo. 
- Working with APIs make it technically challenging, as a GA Web Development student. It was a great experience to create an app using new libraries, environments and packages, handling hundreds of processes running at the same time.
- Through these environments I can built a router, connect to a database, bring in other packages to develop functions, have access to computer 
files system and connect different nodes.
- This app is hosted in Heroku, through the use of mLab to deploy the Mongo database. 
- Boostrap is used for styling. 

RESOURCES
- Node: a piece of software to run JavaScript outside of the browser. It uses npm packages.
- Express: a package to quickly create an application skeleton.  
- Mongo: a data management system. 
- Morgan: installed it works as a logger middleware function. The function is expected to return a string. 
  This will be the log line, or undefined / null to skip the logging function. 
- Json: a package that represents a list of dependencies. A description of the code I'm using. 
- Nodemon: commands to run the code. 
- mLab. to deploy the database in Heroku. 
- Git & GitHub: repositories.

- Framework: Bootstrap.
